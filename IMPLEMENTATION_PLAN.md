# Implementation Plan: Moodle Quiz Chat Solution

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Goal:** Enable quiz-taking in WhatsApp-like chat interface with minimal custom development

**Approach:** Leverage existing FOSS tools (Moodle Matrix + Element X) + small Quiz Bot

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks implementation vs 3+ months building from scratch

## 📱 PWA Experience Confirmation

### Element X as PWA ✅

**Android:**
- Install from Google Play Store OR
- Install as PWA from browser (Add to Home Screen)
- Full offline support with Matrix sync
- Native notifications and background sync

**iPhone:**
- Install from App Store OR  
- Install as PWA from Safari (Add to Home Screen)
- iOS 17.6+ support with full PWA features
- Offline messaging and automatic sync

**Interface:** Explicitly designed to outperform WhatsApp with familiar UX

## 🏗️ Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Moodle Matrix Setup
```bash
# Requirements Check
- Moodle 4.2+ (check current version)
- Matrix server (Synapse recommended)
- Element X client testing
```

**Steps:**
1. **Verify Moodle Version**
   - Check if gs.teebase.net runs Moodle 4.2+
   - If not, coordinate upgrade or use test instance

2. **Matrix Server Setup**
   - **Option A:** Use matrix.org (quick testing)
   - **Option B:** Self-host Synapse (production)
   - **Option C:** Element Server Suite (managed)

3. **Configure Moodle Matrix Integration**
   ```
   Site Administration → Plugins → Communication providers → Matrix
   - Enter Matrix server details
   - Configure API access token
   - Test course room creation
   ```

4. **Test Element X Installation**
   - Install on Android/iPhone
   - Create test accounts
   - Verify course room access
   - Test offline functionality

#### 1.2 Element X Evaluation
**Test these features:**
- PWA installation process
- Offline message storage and sync
- Room creation and management
- Mobile interface usability
- Teacher-student direct messaging

### Phase 2: Quiz Bot Development (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Bot Architecture
```
Quiz Bot Components:
├── Moodle API Client      # Fetch quiz content
├── Matrix SDK Client      # Send/receive messages  
├── Room Manager          # Create per-quiz rooms
├── Question Delivery     # Sequential chat messages
├── Answer Collection     # Process student responses
└── Teacher Notifications # Alert when help needed
```

#### 2.2 Technology Stack
**Recommended:** Python with matrix-nio
```python
# Core dependencies
matrix-nio            # Matrix SDK
requests             # Moodle API calls
asyncio              # Async message handling
python-dotenv        # Configuration
logging              # Debug and monitoring
```

#### 2.3 Bot Development Steps

**Step 1: Basic Matrix Connection**
```python
# quiz_bot.py skeleton
from nio import AsyncClient
import asyncio

class QuizBot:
    def __init__(self, homeserver, username, password):
        self.client = AsyncClient(homeserver, username)
        
    async def login(self):
        # Authenticate with Matrix server
        
    async def join_course_rooms(self):
        # Monitor Moodle-created course rooms
        
    async def handle_quiz_request(self, room_id, user_id):
        # Student requests quiz via command
```

**Step 2: Moodle API Integration** 
```python
class MoodleClient:
    def __init__(self, server_url, token):
        self.server = server_url
        self.token = token
        
    def get_user_courses(self, user_id):
        # Fetch enrolled courses
        
    def get_available_quizzes(self, course_id):
        # Get quizzes available to student
        
    def get_quiz_questions(self, quiz_id):
        # Fetch sequential questions
        
    def submit_quiz_attempt(self, attempt_data):
        # Submit completed quiz
```

**Step 3: Quiz Delivery Logic**
```python
class QuizSession:
    def __init__(self, quiz_id, student_id, room_id):
        self.quiz_id = quiz_id
        self.student_id = student_id
        self.room_id = room_id
        self.current_question = 0
        self.answers = {}
        
    async def start_quiz(self):
        # Create private quiz room
        # Invite student and teacher
        # Send first question
        
    async def handle_answer(self, answer):
        # Store answer
        # Send next question or finish quiz
        
    async def request_help(self):
        # Notify teacher in course room
        # Allow teacher to join quiz room
```

#### 2.4 Quiz Bot Features

**Core Features:**
- Sequential question delivery as chat messages
- Answer collection and validation
- Help request system (Ask Teacher button)
- Progress tracking (Question 3 of 10)
- Quiz completion and submission

**Message Formats:**
```
Bot: 📚 Quiz Available: "Basic Math - Chapter 1"
Bot: Ready to start? Type 'begin' or 'help'

Student: begin

Bot: Question 1 of 5
What is 2 + 2?
A) 3  B) 4  C) 5  D) 6

Student: B

Bot: ✅ Question 2 of 5  
What is 5 × 3?
A) 15  B) 12  C) 18  D) 20

Student: help

Bot: 🆘 Help requested! Mrs. Johnson has been notified.
[Mrs. Johnson joins room]
Mrs. Johnson: Hi! Think about groups of 5...
```

### Phase 3: Teacher Experience (Week 3)

#### 3.1 Teacher Workflow
1. **Course Room Monitoring**
   - See all enrolled students
   - Quiz bot provides status updates
   - "3 students taking Quiz 1, 1 needs help"

2. **Help Request Handling**
   - Notification: "Sarah needs help with Quiz 1, Question 5"
   - Click to join student's quiz room
   - Provide guidance without seeing answers

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Quiz completion notifications
   - Summary of class performance
   - Identify struggling students

#### 3.2 Teacher Notifications
```python
class TeacherNotifications:
    async def notify_help_request(self, teacher_id, student_name, quiz_name):
        # Send Matrix message to course room
        message = f"🆘 {student_name} needs help with {quiz_name}"
        # Include join button for quiz room
        
    async def notify_quiz_completion(self, teacher_id, completion_data):
        # Send summary to teacher
        message = f"✅ {completion_data['student']} completed {completion_data['quiz']}"
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Quiz Bot Deployment Options

**Option 1: Simple Python Script**
```bash
# Run on any server with Python
pip install matrix-nio requests
python quiz_bot.py
```

**Option 2: Docker Container**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "quiz_bot.py"]
```

**Option 3: Cloud Function**
- AWS Lambda / Google Cloud Functions
- Triggered by Matrix webhooks
- Serverless scaling

### Configuration Management
```env
# .env file
MATRIX_HOMESERVER=https://matrix.org
MATRIX_BOT_USERNAME=@quizbot:matrix.org
MATRIX_BOT_PASSWORD=secure_password

MOODLE_SERVER=https://gs.teebase.net
MOODLE_API_TOKEN=your_moodle_token

DEFAULT_COURSE_ID=123
DEBUG_MODE=True
```

### Database Considerations
**Simple Approach:** File-based storage
```python
# Store active quiz sessions
quiz_sessions = {
    "room_id": {
        "student_id": "user123",
        "quiz_id": "quiz456", 
        "current_question": 2,
        "answers": {"q1": "B", "q2": "A"}
    }
}
```

**Production Approach:** SQLite or PostgreSQL
```sql
CREATE TABLE quiz_sessions (
    room_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id TEXT,
    quiz_id TEXT,
    current_question INTEGER,
    answers JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1 Testing (Internal)
1. Set up test Moodle instance
2. Create test Matrix server
3. Deploy quiz bot locally
4. Test with 2-3 users

### Phase 2 Pilot (Small Group)
